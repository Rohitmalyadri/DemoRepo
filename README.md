"Hello!
I'm a second-year Computer Science student with a passion for coding, problem-solving, and innovation. I thrive on challenging myself on platforms like CodeChef, LeetCode, and GeeksforGeeks, constantly sharpening my skills and learning from every experience. Currently, I am diving deep into Java and Data Structures & Algorithms to strengthen my technical foundation.

Recently, I had the opportunity to attend a Winter School focused on Generative AI, which further fueled my enthusiasm for exploring trending technologies. I am particularly excited about working with cutting-edge tools and concepts to develop creative and impactful solutions. My curiosity drives me to innovate and bring fresh ideas to life, and I am eager to collaborate with like-minded professionals to contribute to meaningful tech projects.

I look forward to growing in this ever-evolving field and making a difference through technology!"
